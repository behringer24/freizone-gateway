# Contributing to Freizone Gateway

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome. This file covers the practical side,
plus one thing worth stating up front: contributions require a contributor
licence agreement, and the reason for it is spelled out
[below](#contributor-licence-agreement) rather than left to be discovered.

## What this repository is for

The gateway is deliberately small: it takes a signed "wake this token" request
from a freizone-server and relays it to FCM or APNs. It is public first and
foremost so that claim can be **checked** — the README's
[What the gateway never sees](README.md#what-the-gateway-never-sees) is only
worth anything if the code backing it can be read.

That shapes what belongs here. A change that would let the gateway see more
than which platform and which opaque token to wake — message content, sender or
recipient identity, per-user state, durable logs of who was woken when — is out
of scope regardless of how useful it would otherwise be. If you think something
along those lines is genuinely needed, open an issue and argue the case before
writing it.

## Before you open a pull request

- **Open an issue first for anything non-trivial**, particularly anything
  touching the request-signature scheme or the revocation path — those are
  shared with freizone-server's [`pkg/httpsig`](https://github.com/behringer24/freizone-server/tree/master/pkg/httpsig)
  and cannot drift independently.
- **Keep the build clean:**

  ```sh
  go build ./...
  go vet ./...
  go test ./...
  ```

  All three should pass before you push. There is no CI beyond the release
  image build, so these are run by hand.

- **You do not need a real FCM project to work on most of this.** See
  [Local development](README.md#local-development-no-tls-no-real-fcm-project) —
  the gateway starts fine with no credentials at all and reports the missing
  capability rather than failing.
- **Match the surrounding code.** Comments here explain *why*, not what.
- **Security.** Please do not open a public issue for a vulnerability in the
  signature verification, the replay protection or the revocation handling.
  Report it privately to <info@behringer24.de> first.

## Contributor licence agreement

Every non-trivial contribution to this repository requires that you accept the
agreement below. It is short, and it does one thing the AGPL alone does not: it
lets the copyright in the codebase stay undivided, so the licence can still be
changed later without having to track down and ask every person who ever
contributed.

### Why this project asks for it

Mostly consistency. The three Freizone repositories — server, gateway, and the
Android app — are held under the same terms so that code can move between them
without a licensing question each time, and so that a decision about one is not
quietly foreclosed by an oversight in another. The substantive reasons live in
the [server](https://github.com/behringer24/freizone-server/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
and [app](https://github.com/behringer24/freizone-app/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
repositories; there is no licence change planned for the gateway itself.

Worth knowing either way: running your own gateway never requires anyone's
permission. It holds your own platform credentials, any freizone-server can
point at it, and there is no registration step with anybody — see
[Security model](README.md#security-model-no-registration-revoke-by-key). That
stays true whatever happens to the licence.

### What you keep

You keep the copyright in your own work, and an unrestricted right to use it
however you like, including in other projects and under other licences. This
agreement takes nothing away from you; it adds a permission for the maintainer.

### The agreement

By submitting a contribution to this repository, you agree to the following,
for that contribution and for any future contribution you make here:

1. **Grant of rights.** You grant Andreas Behringer an exclusive, worldwide,
   perpetual, irrevocable, transferable and sublicensable right to use,
   reproduce, modify, adapt, translate, publish, distribute, and otherwise
   exploit your contribution, in whole or in part, alone or combined with other
   work, in any form and by any means whether known today or developed later,
   and to license it to third parties under any terms — including terms
   differing from the licence this project uses at the time you contribute.
   Where the applicable law does not permit copyright itself to be transferred
   (as under German law, § 29 UrhG), this is a grant of exclusive rights of use
   to the fullest extent that law permits.
2. **Licence back to you.** You retain a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual,
   irrevocable right to use, publish and license your own contribution for any
   purpose, under any terms, without restriction and without needing anyone's
   permission.
3. **You are entitled to grant this.** You confirm that the contribution is
   your own work, that you have the right to grant the rights above, and that
   it does not knowingly infringe anyone else's rights. If you wrote it in the
   course of employment or under a contract that might assign rights to someone
   else, you confirm that your employer or client has agreed to this, or that
   the contribution falls unambiguously outside that scope. (Under German law,
   rights in software written by an employee in the course of their duties pass
   to the employer automatically — § 69b UrhG — so this matters more often than
   people expect.)
4. **Patents.** To the extent your contribution is covered by a patent you own
   or control, you grant a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free
   licence to that patent, as far as is necessary to use, distribute and
   sublicense your contribution as part of this project.
5. **No warranty.** Your contribution is provided as-is. Except where the law
   provides otherwise, you give no warranty and accept no liability for it.

### Small changes

Fixing a typo, rewording a comment, correcting a broken link or reformatting
existing code does not need this. There is no original creative content in such
a change, so there is nothing to license.

### How to accept it

Include this line in the description of your pull request:

> I have read CONTRIBUTING.md and I accept the Contributor Licence Agreement in
> it, for this and all my future contributions to this repository.

Your GitHub account and the pull request itself are the record. If a signing
bot is set up later, it will replace this step; anything accepted this way
stays valid.

If you are contributing on behalf of a company, or anything above does not fit
your situation, get in touch before you start — open an issue, or write to
<info@behringer24.de>. It is far easier to sort out beforehand.
